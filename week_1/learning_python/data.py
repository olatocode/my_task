# Basic usage of print()
print("Hello, world")
print("welcome to python programming")

# Using print() with variables

name = "Aisha"
age = 25
print("name:", name)
print("age:", age)

# Using f-string with print()
name = "Bola"
score = 92
print(f"{name} scored {score} in the exam.")


#Using string concatenation
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
print("full name : " + first_name + " " + last_name)

# Comma vs concatenation
print("Hello", "world!")
print("Hello" + " " + "world!")
